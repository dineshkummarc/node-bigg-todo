Install

```
git clone git@github.com:swbiggart/node-bigg-todo.git
cd node-bigg-todo
npm install coffee-script -g
npm install
coffee app.coffee

Make sure you have MongoDB installed.  If you don't, on a Mac use Homebrew:

```
brew install mongodb
```
and follow the instructions.

Or, you can checkout the localStorage branch to use without MongoDB
